# Morse-Code-Communication-System-with-Micro-Bit-
Morse code translation while communicating between 2 or more micro: Bit devices.

In order to see the Microbit code work in a simulation or connect to a micro: Bit, Download the code and import it to this website:
https://makecode.microbit.org/

There will be a simulation there and you can download it onto your 2 micro: Bits and modify the code how you like

Thanks
